# Main Features

This document outlines the main features of the Event Talks App.

*   **Dynamic Schedule:** The conference schedule is dynamically loaded from a JSON file (`talks.json`). This allows for easy updates to the schedule without changing the application's code.

*   **Search by Category:** Users can filter the talks by category using the search bar. The search is case-insensitive and filters the talks in real-time as the user types.

*   **Simple Interface:** The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface for browsing the event schedule. The schedule is displayed in a chronological order, with clear time slots for each talk.

*   **Lunch Break:** A lunch break is automatically inserted into the schedule after the third talk.
